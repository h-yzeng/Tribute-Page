# Tribute-Page
This is one of the required projects to earn the Responsive Web Design Certification on FreeCodeCamp.

This tribute page is dedicated to the internet revolution that changed everyone's lives from the 1960s up to the early 2010s.  

For this project, I built a tribute page for the internet revolution using vanilla HTML and CSS.
