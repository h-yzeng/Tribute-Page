This is one of the required projects to earn the Responsive Web Design Certification on FreeCodeCamp.

This tribute page is dedicated to the history and impact of the internet revolution that changed everyone's lives from the 1960s to the early 2010s.  

This project is a simple webpage built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS highlighting the significant milestones and effects of the Internet Revolution on modern society.

## User Stories / Project Requirements

The following user stories were implemented to complete this project:

1. Your tribute page should have a `main` element with a corresponding `id` of `main`, which contains all other elements.
2. You should see an element with an `id` of `title`, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
3. You should see either a `figure` or a `div` element with an `id` of `img-div`.
4. Within the `#img-div` element, you should see an `img` element with a corresponding `id="image"`.
5. Within the `#img-div` element, you should see an element with a corresponding `id="img-caption"` that contains textual content describing the image shown in `#img-div`.
6. You should see an element with a corresponding `id="tribute-info"`, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
7. You should see an `a` element with a corresponding `id="tribute-link"`, which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. **HINT**: You must give your element an attribute of `target` and set it to `_blank` in order for your link to open in a new tab.
8. Your `#image` should use `max-width` and `height` properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
9. Your `img` element should be centered within its parent element.
